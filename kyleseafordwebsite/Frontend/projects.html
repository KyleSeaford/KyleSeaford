                <strong>IBM SERVERS:</strong> I had the opportunity to acquire a collection of 12 IBM servers, consisting of 7 M3's, 2 M2's and 1 M4 model. In addition to these, I also acquired 6 HP ProLiant DL160 Generation 5 servers. Recognizing the potential value in these hardware assets, I embarked on a meticulous process to restore and refurbish them to their optimal working condition. Through my efforts, I have successfully resolved any technical issues and ensured that these servers are fully operational. Some of the servers are now used for hosting some of my websites and running programs like <a href="https://ollama.com/" target="_blank">ollama</a>, a locally hosted ai.

                <strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> I mined XMR coins using Linux and Windows Monero miners. Learning to mine enabled me to understand how to install Linux and use Putty to control the computer remotely using SSH. I also explored the possibility of using old mobile phones for mining; however, the Android power-saving functionality prevented mining on the phone. To overcome this obstacle, I removed the phone's operating system and installed Linux. This experience not only expanded my knowledge of cryptocurrency but also deepened my understanding of Linux and its applications.

                <strong>Arduino battle bots:</strong> I used Arduino Nanos to create two Bluetooth-controlled robots: Ram Bot and Wacker. Ram Bot showcased versatility, tackling various tasks and obstacle courses. Wacker, on the other hand, specialized in precise movements. These projects not only displayed my technical skills but also my passion for robotics and innovation, highlighting the creative potential of technology.

                <strong>Pi-Wars:</strong> In 2017 and 2018, my family enthusiastically joined <a href="https://piwars.org/" target="_blank">Pi-Wars</a> at Cambridge University, a robotics competition where all robots were powered by Raspberry Pis. This unique event featured non-combat challenges such as navigating mazes, precision line-following, and even robotic mini-golf. It was an invaluable experience that allowed us to showcase our technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork while exploring the exciting world of Raspberry Pi-powered robotics. This was the start of my journey into robotics and programming.
